	<_summary>Maybe a Gnome shell like dashboard for Xfce</_summary>

	<description>
		<_p>Xfdashboard provides a GNOME shell dashboard like interface
		for use with Xfce desktop.
		</_p>
		<_p>It can be configured to run to any keyboard shortcut and
		when executed provides an overview of applications currently
		open enabling the user to switch between different applications.
		The search feature works like Xfce's app finder which makes
		it convenient to search for and start applications.
