    Fix crash when moving selection after current selection was destroyed
    
    We connect to "destroy" signal at current selection and if it gets destroyed we move selection to next or previous actor whatever is available. Then we disconnect signal handler on old selection and connect it at new selection.

    Emit "loaded" or "loading-failed" signal each time XfdashboardImage was attached
    
    Do not only emit these signals only once which can only retrieved by actor already created and already attached to theses signal. Emit these signals also each time an already loaded image is attached. But keep attention: You have to connect to these signals _before_ the image is attached to an actor and after the signal's callback was called it should be disconnected.

    Try to create GDesktopAppInfo for GarconMenuItem first then fallback to previous method
    
    We try first to create a GDesktopAppInfo for the requested GarconMenuItem. If it succeeds launching the application via this GDesktopAppInfo will behave as expected, e.g. setting working directory from "Path=..." of desktop file etc. If this creation fails fallback to old method with its restriction, e.g. not setting the working directory etc.

    Workaround if loading themed icon via filename with extension is not supported by default
    
    In cases where _xfdashboard_image_content_load_from_icon_name() gets a filename with extension, e.g. "skype.png", and gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon() fails to lookup icon then fallback to lookup icon without extension. But before doing this lookup we check if gdk-pixbuf supports this file extension at any of its formats.

    Simplify checking visibility of a garcon menu element
    
    Just call get_visible() on a GarconMenuElement as it will do already all extensive checks if this element should be visible or not. There is no need to do our additional checks because they are already done. But we still have to count the number of visible sub-menus and menu items to determine if we should show or hide a menu.

    Do not list empty menus in application menu model
    
    To prevent listing empty menus we iterate through the menu items of a menu first and look if there is at least one visible (sub-)menu or menu item. If we do not find any visible ones we do not process this menu and do not add it to list of menus so it will not show up.

    Add support to prevent upscaling beyond real size in XfdashboardScaledTableLayout
    
    The layout manager XfdashboardScaledTableLayout got a new property called "prevent-upscaling" which is set to FALSE by default. This property manages if layout manager is allowed to scale a child larger than its real natural size or not. The windows view uses this new property and exports it by itself to allow windows to be scaled beyond their real size or not. As it is a stylable property it can be control by a theme.

    Warning: Massive API break because of renamed class and functions. Renamed XfdashboardImage to XfdashboardImageContent to keep class name in sync with naming convention I used so far (see XfdashboardWindowContent for a ClutterContent derived class and ClutterImage, which XfdashboardImage is derived from, is also a ClutterContent derived class). Also XfdashboardImage is now free e.g. for an actor utilizing XfdashboardImageContent.

    Move stylable functions into an interface
    
    XfdashboardActor will not implement and provide styling possibilities but implements the new stylable interface (XfdashboardStylable). Moving the functionality into an interface gives us the opportunity to style non-actors also (anytime later).
    
    Why should non-actors be stylable by CSS? That's because non-actors like XfdashboardWindowContents or XfdashboardImage will be visible because they are used by (visible and drawn) actors. This is not implemented yet but prepared.

    Rename key in theme file from "LayoutPrimary" to "Layout"
    
    When writing documentation about how to layout xfdashboard I saw that is was not wise to name the key "LayoutPrimary". Because the key takes a list of file, separated by semicolon, there is no need to differ between layout files and their purposes. Only the attribute "id" of the object element which is the child of interface needs to set correctly.

    Fix visual bug when drawing outlines of XfdashboardBackground derived actors
    
    The outline was drawn when virtual paint_node() function of XfdashboardBackground was drawn. Any XfdashboardBackground derived object could easily overdraw outline. Outline is now a effect which takes care that outline is drawn last and is always visible. Also a new property "outline-borders" (XfdashboardBackground) which "maps" to "borders" in new XfdashboardOutlineEffect class and manages which sides (and also which rounded corner) should be drawn.

    Added infrastructure for search providers. Registered search providers will be called each time a search is performed - either as full search or as incremental search to a previous one if each search term in new search is a prefix of its counterpart in new search and if their order did not change. Search provider can use any source for their search but have to create an actor for each item in their result if requested. The newly added search manager manages all search providers at one place. Search view was rewritten to use this new search infrastructure.

    Remove write-only properties in XfdashboardImage
    
    The write-only properties removed are only used once for setting up XfdashboardImage. To ensure they could only set once and only from inside XfdashboardImage replace these properties with private functions.

    Do not resize stage after window was opened
    
    This commit addresses issue #1. It seems that starting with clutter 1.16 the way how the stage window is created within clutter changed resulting that coordinates in stage window were transformed wrongly although there were no visible differences. By setting stage actor's size (and therefore window size) when actor is created and before window is created by clutter the right transformation was restored.

    Support to get stylable properties of requested class only or of all parent classes as well
    
    xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties is splitted into two functions: xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties and xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties_full. The first one will fill the hashtable only with stylable properties of requested and the latter one will also get the stylable properties of all parent classes recursively.

    Fix bug that XfdashboardCollapseBox collapse even if pointer device is still inside actor
    
    There are a few situations where only a "leave-event" signal without a following "enter-event" signal is emitted although the pointer is still inside the XfdashboardCollapseBox actor. So the actor is shrinked to minimum size accidently. This happens most when switching through workspaces. So we first check if the new target actor is a direct or deeper child of the collapse box and if it is not then we check if the actor under pointer device is a direct or deeper child. If both checks fails then the pointer device should be really outside the collapse box and it is allowed to shrink to minimum size.

    Added missing license in file COPYING
    
    If I understood the table at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility then I could not use any other license than GPL-2+ because all library I use (or better I link to) are LGPL-2.1 only or LGPL-2.1+ except for xfconf. xfconf might be GPL-2 only and incompatible to GPL-3 or its LGPL-2.1 only but compatible to GPL-3. xfconf mixes the "short license text" in source code and includes GPL-2 in COPYING. As long as I cannot determine the "real" license I use GPL-2 just in case.
    
    My thoughts are only valid if I understood the table and if linking to other libraries is "I want to use a library" (in context of table).

    By connecting to signal "reload-required" at each GarconMenu we get notified if menu structure or menu items changed (e.g. an application was installed or removed). The XfdashboardApplicationModel will then clear and (re-)load itself to get the new menu structure. After that it emits signal "loaded" (as it will on creation) to notify all handlers about (re-)load.

    Consider minimized window as visible ones.
    
    In real minimized windows are hidden but with additional flag "minimized". To distinguish between completely hidden window and just minimized window we check flag "minimized" additionally. Only if flag "hidden" is set and "minimized" flag is not set the window is recognized as hidden by application. Without this differentiation also minimized window will not show up in windows view and will not be selectable or restorable to previous state (a visible state) anymore. At least not via xfdashboard but via task switcher (ALT+Tab).

    This change should ensure that each remote instance will force the primary instance to resume (means show the stage window). Before this change g_application_activate() called from remote instance did not send the dbus signal to the primary instance or the signal did not reach the primary instance. Because of this the stage window was not (re-)shown reliable.

    We cannot assume that each window newly opened or moved to a workspace will be on top of all other windows. It highly depends on the window manager and personal settings. We need to respect window stacking. Therefore we iterate through list of windows in stacking order to find the last window the live workspace has an actor for before we the window requested to insert a new actor at this position or move an existing window actor to this position.

    Remove accidently left over debugging code in XfdashboardDragAction

commit d0895e5919d6dfef58d9853cc8228969819fc3ea
Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Tue Dec 24 23:48:08 2013 +0100

    To prevent emiting our motion events in XfdashboardDragAction on actors being destroyed while drag is in progress (e.g. a window actor was destroyed because its window was closed) we connect to 'destroy' signal of each "motion actor" added to list. The signal handler will be removed either on actor's destruction by signal handler's callback, when pointer leaves actor or on end of drag.

    Actor must be one same stage where event happened when handling motion events for enter/leave/motion.

commit 4fef9ccb00efbd9842437dd5439bb5f92d0fac2f
Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Tue Dec 24 16:00:53 2013 +0100

    Add new actor XfdashboardCollapseBox which holds (better: handles) only one child and acts like a expander. The stage puts XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector into such a collapse box to save space in stage. The workspace selector will then expand as soon as the pointer moves into it and will collapse when pointer moved out. XfdashboardDragAction has to handle and emit 'enter-event', 'leave-event' and 'motion-event' on its own because ClutterDragAction will turn off motion handling but it is needed to keep XfdashboardCollapseBox functional. That means the collapse box should still expand and collapse while a drag is in progress.

    Display timeout of notification depends on length of text to display. Personally I say that one seconds for 50 characters should be enough. But we never drop below the default notification timeout (currently hard-coded to 3 seconds).

    Remove any reference to libwnck in all object except for window tracker related objects. Window tracker objects wrap libwnck resources directly but are accessible in a "virtual" stable API. Doing it this way should provide a stable API for libwnck throughout all code and the only place to work with #ifdef's to work around changing libwnck API are the window tracker objects.

    Bundle all signal handlers for libwnck signals in a simple window manager called XfdashboardWindowTracker and connect all windows/workspace related signals in all other objects to this new window tracker. Simply said: The window tracker is a proxy to the underlying window managing library.

    Windows view should now really always fit into viewpad without scrollbars to flicker. There is caution to use the new enum XFDASHBOARD_FIT_MODE_BOTH as the view _MUST_ be able to scale itself to fit into allocation _ALWAYS_ otherwise it will be clipped without being able to scroll (as there are no scrollbars in this mode).

    Bad workaround for click action which prevents e.g. drag actions to work properly at least since clutter version 1.12. The click action will always win and "drag-begin" will never be emitted.
    
    This object/file is a complete copy of the original clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of clutter 1.12 except for one line, renamed function names and applied coding style. As the clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of later clutter versions do not differ much from this one this object is expected to work even in this versions.

    Until I added a property to XfdashboardApplicationsView to switch between list and icon mode and calling filter_changed signal handler explicitly I should move the code after the part which creates the layout manager for this view.

    Added new actor called XfdashboardApplicationButton which is a button but its text and icon to display is retrieved either by a GarconMenuElement or a GAppInfo. This actor can also the associated application defined by either one of them. The application view was modified to use them.

    Implemented applications menu model which collects menu entries via garcon library. It can be used to display menu entries in a view in different ways: all entries, all entries of a menu and by sections like games, office etc. Two helper functions will help to filter the entries by menu or section.
    
    Changed applications view to show applications menu entries instead of a clock ;) Clicking on a folder will show its contents but clicking on a menu item will start the associated application.
    
    Also improved view to allow to scroll to requested position.

    Implement action signal to scroll any view. The viewpad will react on scoll-to signals of any view (active or inactive ones) and scroll to requested position either by setting scrollbar values directly (if active view) or by updating clipping data (inactive views).

Date:   Fri Sep 6 16:15:53 2013 +0200

    Improved viewpad to allow fitting a view in one direction into viewpad. Therefore a new virtual function (*set_fit_mode) was added to abstract class XfdashboardView for reacting on fit mode changed in view (new type XfdashboardFitMode). Corrected scrollbar and clipping behaviour of viewpad.

    Correct allocation related functions. The button widget was not able to determine and allocate its size correctly especially if icon's size should synchronize to label's width or height (depending on its orientation).

    Renamed XfdashboardFitBoxLayout to XfdashboardFillBoxLayout as I think the name matches better to its function.

commit 960fe241050c95ed393a8a3fa2754eb279e254c5
Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Mon Aug 19 23:23:47 2013 +0200

    Implemented basic version of XfdashboardFitBoxLayout which layouts children like ClutterBoxLayout but takes care to fit into parent actor's width or height depending on orientation. It will alway set width or height of every child to match parent's size but it can scale it to keep aspect ratio if wanted. When implementing this layout manager also some minor errors and misbehaviours of some other actors were corrected (and hopefully throw no warnings or criticals anymore).

    Speed up scrolling because it got worse after speeding up search. The reason was that each time the scrollbar moved (value-changed signal emitted) all actors were re-allocated and re-layouted even the hidden ones. Speeding it up by just moving view and clipping of view but only it view has clipping.

As soon as I crossed an application icon in quicklaunch it stopped emitting signals to underlying quicklaunch.

    Set minimum version of external libraries as requirements to avoid using macros not available and makes handling different version a lot harder. BTW libwnck below 2.10 is
    very old and hardly in use nowadays so we can not support these versions. Also made compiler more quiet with -std=gnu99 but should be still warn.
