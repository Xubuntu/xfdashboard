    Rewrote function xfdashboard_window_tracker_get_root_window() to lookup desktop window
    
    Rewrote function to lookup desktop window by trying first to get window by known background pixmap ID and if it fails it will iterate through window list to lookup a window of type 'desktop'. If both methods fail, NULL will be returned to indicate that there is no matching window.
    
    This should fix issue GH #80

    Decide at run-time not at compile-time if we need to track screen size changes to adjust stage size.
    
    I hope this fixes GH #95 finally.

    Try not to eat up CPU ... again!
    
    Do not emit 'window-geometry-changed' signals when application was suspended because there will be no visual changes. It is unneccessary to handle this signal.
    
    Instead disconnect signal handler to 'geometry-changed' from windows at window tracker if the application is suspended and reconnect them if application resumes. Because we track the window's last position and size we emit a 'window-geometry-changed' for each window at application resume when it has been moved or resized in the meantime.
    
    This should lower CPU usage while application is suspended and a window is moved or resized.

    Implement signal to notify if a window has moved to another monitor
    
    Implement a new signal 'window-monitor-changed' at window tracker to signal that a window has moved from one monitor to another. This is done by tracking the last position and size to determine the old monitor where this window was placed. If the new position and size of this window is at another monitor this new signal is emitted.
    
    This signal is used by the windows view to determine if the moved window has to stay in this view or if another window view instance has to create an actor for this window and to handle it.
    
    This new signal is only useful in multi-monitor setups.

    Mark property 'gravity' deprecated and introduce new property 'anchor-point' at XfdashboardEmblemEffect
    
    Gravity does not describe well what this property is used for. So rename gravity to anchor point and replace all occurences with new definition and type.
    
    This deprecates property 'gravity' and a warning is printed each time this property is set to a new value.

    Always check if window is on workspace in windows view
    
    Previously it was check if a workspace is set at windows view and if it was then it was check if windows is on workspace. If a workspace was not set it was assumed that window is visible. This resulted in creating a window actor for each window at start-up which. After start-up a workspace was set which caused all window actor to be destroyed and for all windows which are now on the workspace set were recreated. This delayed start-up because lots of window actor had to be created twice.
    
    Now we assume a window to be hidden if a workspace is not set because if windows view don't know the workspace no window could match it. This reduces start-up time a lot because no window actor is created twice but only once and creating window textures is a time consuming task.

    Enforce X11 backend in Clutter
    
    Beginning with Clutter 1.21 the default backend changes to GDK. It is not X11 anymore in our case. But this application relies heavily on old default backend. So a hacky workaround is to enforce X11 backend again. This commit addresses issue #73

    Replace dependency on libwnck-1.0 (minimum version 2.30) with libwnck-3.0 (minimum version 3.0)
    
    We depend on GTK+3 (version 3.2 or higher) in settings application and for some GTK+ functions in xfdashboard but we also depend on libwnck for window handling. Using libwnck-1.0 triggers to include GDK2 from GTK+2 resulting in a mix of GTK+ 2 and 3 what is really bad although it seems to work pretty well. In order to not mix both major GTK+ and to depend only on one GTK+ version the minimum version of libwnck had to raised up to 3.0 and since then we had to depend on libwnck-3.0 instead of libwnck-1.0.

    Implementing XfdashboardApplicationDatabase
    
    XfdashboardApplicationDatabase is a new class combining all sources for applications. It wraps the GarconMenu instance for the root menu which contains all sub-menus and menu item. It also provides a cache for all installed applications via their desktop files whereby user overridden desktop files have higher priority than system-wide installed desktop files. Also file monitors for each directory will be created to keep track of modifications to either the desktop files or directories. It can see when a new user created desktop file overrides a system-wide desktop file and vice versa - keeping track of them in a cache accessible via the desktop ID. Modifications, overrides or restored (means user-defined desktop file is deleted and system-wide desktop file is the one again) will emit the "change" signal on XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo instances to notify any actor, connected to this signal, that the appearance should be checked and adjusted to the modified file.

    Impleting XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo
    
    XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo is a new class wrapping a GarconMenuItem and a string for the desktop ID and it also implements the GAppInfo interface. So it can be used - more or less - as a drop-in replacement for GDesktopAppInfo. Each function of GAppInfo interface is implemented except for function regarding to mime type associations. This class wraps GarconMenuItem to gain all it's advantages over GDesktopAppInfo, e.g. supporting desktop file of type "Link" to start a web-browser with the url specified in desktop file. It also forwards the "changed" signal of GarconMenuItem (if it did set up a file monitor for it) to notify about changes to the menu item and the desktop file. So an actor could adjust its appearing to the changes made.
    
    This class also has an advance lookup function for desktop IDs containing dashes. It should find a desktop file for nearly any possible combination of a dash being a directory separator or being part of the file/directory name.

    Using macros like G_SOURCE_* too often but they were introduced with version 2.32 of Glib so raise minimum version to version 2.32. Also include checking for GLib in configure.ac.in and include CFLAGS and LIBS of GLib in Makefile.am although GIO should pull them in. This should harden the build system again build errors and mistakes.

    Respect configure options --[enable/disable]-xcomposite and --[enable/disable]-xdamage by checking if X11 extensions exist _AND_ set variables for Makefile to include necessary include paths and needed libs depending on the configure option.
    
    Before I just checked the existence of required packages but nothing more. This means that enabling any of both extension was requested at 'configure' but clutter was not compiled with this extension the build must fail because the required header files and libraries were not be include because I did not add them in Makefile explicitly. I was relying on Clutter to be built with this extension and pulling them in.

    The old implementation lost the focus after a longer run (after 5 up to 15 minutes after start-up). So try another implementation using the X11 extension Xtst. This implementation is based on the ideas of ksuperkey/xcape and x11grabbr.
    
    Hopefully this solves issue #69

    Hotkey tracker could loose new focus and will never be able to "reconnect" to focus events to restore tracking capabilitites. Once the new focus is lost the hotkey will not function anymore. Therefore also reset focus when the active window changes to re-setup event notifications.

    Add hotkey tracker
    
    The hotkey tracker will watch all key events globally and toggle application state when hotkey was recognized. Toggling means suspending application if is currently active or resuming application if not. Currently the hotkey is haard-coded to left Super key and right Super key.
    
    Reacting to hotkey presses is disabled by default. It has to be enabled by setting Xfconf's property "/hotkey-enabled" to boolean TRUE.
    
    The hotkey tracker is only usable in daemon mode but works also when running standalone. In the last case it will quit xfdashboard if hotkey is pressed but it cannot activate xfdashboard (because therefore it needs to be running in daemon mode otherwise the needed code is not running ;) )

    Add "--restart" option to command-line to restart application
    
    This option can used to restart daemon after an update - for example. But "--daemon" must be given also, otherwise a stand-alone version would be started.
    
    I know it was done a little bit complicated but I think it handles nearly all kinds of restart possibilities.

    Allow icon of search provider in search view result container to be themable
    
    This is achieved by adding two items.
    
    The first one is a themable property named "icon" in XfdashboardSearchResultContainer which expects a string with a themed icon name or a filename of the icon to display.
    
    The second one is a CSS class which will be added to XfdashboardSearchResultContainer. The CSS class name is build with a prefix "search-provider-" followed by the search provider's object name (like XfdashboardApplicationsSearchProvider for the applications search provider) - so the complete CSS class name would be ".search-provider-XfdashboardApplicationsSearchProvider" (for use in CSS) in this case.

    Allow scroll events in windows view to change active workspace
    
    Like XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector the windows view should change active workspace on scroll event, e.g. mouse-wheel up or down. But it should be configurable so a new xfconf property "/components/windows-view/scroll-event-changes-workspace" was introduced which is a boolean value to indicate if it should change active workspace on scroll events (value is TRUE) or not (value is FALSE)..
    
    This fixes issue #41

    Add more bindable actions
    
    Views can now be activated and focused (at once - simultaneously) but only if attribute "allow-unfocusable-targets" is set to true or 1 in bindings configuration file.
    
    If attribute "allow-unfocusable-targets" is set to true or 1 it indicates that also unfocusable actor should be included when resolving targets. It should be used with caution because it needs the action function to set focusable state of actor to be true.

    Split bindings into two seperate classes: bindings pool and binding
    
    By splitting XfdashboardBindings into two seperate classes XfdashboardBinding (a keyboard or pointer binding) and XfdashboardBindingsPool (a collection of bindings with actions associated) the code should be easier to read, to maintain and to extent.

    Implement key-bindings configuration
    
    Implemented a new configuration option. The application uses now a dynamic keyboard binding configuration instead of hard-coded key bindings like key 'Left' for select the item left of the currently selected item in a focusable actor. The configuration file is a XML file describing type of binding (although only key bindings are supported yet), the keycode and modifiers for the binding and the source and the action signal to perform when this key combination (of keycode and modifiers) are pressed or released at the actor specified.
    
    The application lookups up first a user-defined keyboard binding configuration file at 'xfdashboard/bindings.xml' the user's configuration folder which is ${HOME}/.config/xfdashboard/bindings.xml usually. If the file is not found at this path it looks up a system-wide keyboard configuration file which is a default one installed by xfdashboard, usually at /usr/share/xfdashboard/bindings.xml. The application will quit with error if none was found.

    Apply new theme while running application
    
    This commit addresses and should fix issue #59. Rewrote XfdashboardApplication and XfdashboardStage to reload theme when xfconf property 'theme-name' changes. This introduces XfdashboardStageInterface as top-level actor for a stage (screen).
    
    Sadly this also breaks current theme API. All references in CSS and XML files to class XfdashboardStage have to be replaced to XfdashboardStageInterface. The new actor XfdashboardStageInterface shares the same stylable properties as XfdashboardStage and all changes to XfdashboardStageInterface will be applied to XfdashboardStage on-the-fly. So XfdashboardStageInterface is a one-to-one in-place replacement for XfdashboardStage.
    
    It is not the nicest solution as I wanted it to be but it could also be a preparation work for multi-monitor support (issue #14).

    Ensure right size of window actor and window content
    
    XfdashboardLiveWindow determines its size from XfdashboardWindowContent which either returns the size of the corresponding window if fallback is used or size of window content texture if fallback is not used. If application is suspended (and also all XfdashboardWindowContent objects) and it resumes the texture still returns the old size even if the window was resized in the meantime. This fix ensures that XfdashboardWindowContent returns window's real size if fallback is used (like before) or if it is suspended (that's new) otherwise it returns the size of window content texture (like before).
    
    This fix addresses issue #54

    Forget to adjust global line offset before parsing CSS file going to be imported

    Adjust line of selector's source to a global line offset
    
    This is needed because an imported CSS file via @import(...) will start at line 1 although it is included virtually into the current CSS file at the line where @import is issued. So the imported CSS file and all following lines in the current CSS file need to be adjusted. That is what the global line offset is for. This corrects sorting matching selectors when priority is equal and the line in file where the matching selector is checked (see _xfdashboard_theme_css_sort_by_score).

    Implement '@import' function in CSS
    
    The @import function allows to import other CSS styles from other files. The syntax is: @import(filename). The filename can be an absolute or relative path. The filename should be quoted with either by single or double quotation marks but it must not. Relative paths will be looked up first relative to the path of current CSS file being parsed. If no such file exists the relative path will be used relative the theme's path.

    Try not to eat up CPU
    
    If a new window is created an instance of XfdashboardWindowContent is created and xfdashboard_window_content_set_window is called once for this new window. This function sets up the window content object to retrieve live updates. But it also sets up for live updates if xfdashboard is running in daemon mode and it is not active at this time. The result is that the window content texture is updated in background all the time until xfdashboard gets active and is suspended again then the window content's suspend function is called which stops listening for live update until xfdashboard is resumed.
    
    This CPU usage is unneccessary so call window content's suspend function immediately in xfdashboard_window_content_set_window after it has been set up for live update to reduce CPU usage again.
    
    I hope this fixes issue #44

    The workaround is as follows:
    * Set up signal handlers to get notified about changes of window
    * Unminimize window
    * If window is visible it will be activated by design (we shoud reactivate last active window - but this is _NOT_ implemented now!)
    * Minimize window again
    * Stop watching for changes of window by disconnecting signal handlers
    
    Please notice: The daemon mode of xfdashboard is _NOT_ tested now!

    Implement effects into XfdashboardActor
    
    XfdashboardActor has a new property 'effects' which takes a space-separated list of IDs of effects to create. The IDs must be found in effects XML file specified in "Effects=..." in theme description file xfdashboard.theme. The default theme defines a 'black-white' effect which decolorizes the actor and all quicklaunch buttons will get this effect added but the list is emptied at hovered button in quicklaunch. Effects can be expensive (seen from performance point of view) so changing effects on hover is a bad idea. So the default theme is currently a bad theme but a visible example was needed :(

    Adding XML parser for effects to theme
    
    First step in closing issue #34 by implementing a XML parser to theme which can read in XML data for effects. To get an effect XML file loaded the descriptive xfdashboard.theme file needs a new entry "Effects=" with a semi-colon separated list of files to load. The new XfdashboardThemeEffects object still misses the "real" creation function and also the basic XfdashboardActor does not make any use of it yet. But this is also only step one ;)

    Move selection if current one gets unavailable
    
    The new generic selection frameworks now recognizes if the current selection is getting unavailable because the current selected actor is going to be hidden or destroyed. Then it moves the selection to next available and selectable actor. Focusable actors do not need to handle destroyed actor which are selected by themselve anymore so remove this code logic (XfdashboardQuicklaunch and XfdashboardWindowsView).

    Simplify and generalize selection handling
    
    Implemented a generic and common selection handling framework in XfdashboardFocusable. This has the advantage that we do not need to shift the key focus around between nothing and search box's text-box. We can also implement more common key press/release event like HOME and END keys to select first or last selectable item at the current focussed actor. Currently the keys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, HOME, END, ENTER are recognized by this framework. Still missing are PAGE_UP and PAGE_DOWN. The disadvantage is that "uncommon" key events like CTRL+ENTER have to be catched by signal handler connected to 'key-press-event" and 'key-release-event' at the actor in question like XfdashboardWindowsView.
    
    The search view is the only actor/view not implementing this framework as the decision if search view should be completely rewritten was not yet made.
    
    This is also preparation work for (maybe coming) plugins.

    Avoid closing windows accidently with key <Backspace>
    
    A window can accidently be closed when starting a search by typing and correcting more letters than entered with key <Backspace>. Because then the view switchs from search view back to windows view, sets the focus to a window in the windows and the additional <Backspace> key press will close it. Changed behaviour that the shift key has to be pressed also when using <Backspace>. <Delete> will still work as before.

    Split key handling function in XfdashboardFocusable into "specialized" functions for 'key-press' and 'key-release' events. This make handling repeative 'key-press' event easier and cleaner (code), e.g. for moving selection when key is pressed and hold pressed. 'key-release' is only called once when pressed key is released.

    Allow showing real desktop background in stage background window
    
    Introduce properties 'background-image-type' to XfdashboardStage. It defaults to 'none' but if set to 'desktop' as in default theme it will lookup the desktop image of current screen and hide all windows but show desktop background.

    Fix loading scalable images by icon name
    
    Load images by icon name with scaling at requested size. If file to load is a bitmap it should already be at right size but if is scalable image (svg) is was loaded as a too small bitmap and then scaled resulting in an ugly image but now should look good and "right-scaled".

    Revert changes to _xfdashboard_image_content_setup_for_icon to allow empty icon names
    
    Revert changes to _xfdashboard_image_content_setup_for_icon in XfdashboardImageContent which allows to fallback to fallback icon (aka missing image) if an empty string was set, e.g. by @try_icons in CSS. Empty string will now prevent loading any image as intended. To fallback to fallback icon in @try_icon you should declare a constant like @missing-icon with either the icon name to fallback to or with @try_icons(...) function with a list of fallback icons to try. This @missing-icon can be used in CSS with "@try_icons(..., ..., ..., @missing-icon);". This variant is used in xfdashboard's default theme.

    Implement file @-functions in CSS
    
    The CSS parser was extended with a file function called @try_icons. This functions take a variable number of strings as functions arguments and lookups each one in the order they are given. The first argument which can be lookuped successfully will be returned. If no none can be lookuped an empty string will be returned which causes xfdashboard to load the fallback icon (aka missing icon). Each argument can either be an absolute path, a relative path to theme's path or a (stock) icon name. This commit closes issue #9

    Alpha color component in @rgba() is a factor between 0.0 and 1.0 and not a common color component
    
    Fix alpha function parameter retrieval and calculation. It was a mistake to handle the alpha color component as a common color component which can be defined either an integer between 0 and 255 or as a percentage between 0% and 100%. The alpha color component is a factor and therefore must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.

Additionally the errors returned by CSS parser should be more descriptive. This commit closes issue #8

    Improve search speed a little bit
    
    Improve search speed by caching loaded .desktop files. Before this commit each time the result list is retrieved, each item' .desktop file was loaded, parsed and additional information retrieved. Then this result list was sorted what caused the .desktop files being loaded, parsed etc. or each item. To avoid this each .desktop loaded will be cached so it will be only loaded once. At my slowest machine this reduced the mean search time for the term 'a' from 350ms to 240ms.

    Allow the properties '{x,y}-expand' and '{x,y}-align' to be themable. This addresses issue #28 to avoid that a cell in XfdashboardDynamicTableLayout is always filled completely by child (and its background). To avoid this set 'x-expand' and/or 'y-expand' to 'false' - maybe also set '{x,y}-align' accordingly to position child in available allocation space (e.g. set to 'center').

    Set default hint label in search-box if none was set
    
    Check if a hint text was set and set default hint label if not. XfdashboardTextBox exports a read-only property "hint-text-set" for this purpose. If either an empty or non-empty (but not NULL) string is set as hint label this flag will be set TRUE. A NULL string will unset "hint-text-set" property, means set to FALSE.
    
    To get the default hint label set in search-box just do _not_ set property "hint-text" in theme's layout file. To get an empty hint label specify an empty "hint-text" in theme's layout file. Otherwise set hint label to the text wanted.

    Use new application icon in desktop files
    
    Mofied the wrong .desktop file which got overridden by .desktop.in and .desktop.in.in. So commit f36f3459e06da8172f73650b32cc155682a2bce1 did not include the changes.

    Emit "loaded" or "loading-failed" signal each time XfdashboardImage was attached
    
    Do not only emit these signals only once which can only retrieved by actor already created and already attached to theses signal. Emit these signals also each time an already loaded image is attached. But keep attention: You have to connect to these signals _before_ the image is attached to an actor and after the signal's callback was called it should be disconnected.

    Try to create GDesktopAppInfo for GarconMenuItem first then fallback to previous method
    
    We try first to create a GDesktopAppInfo for the requested GarconMenuItem. If it succeeds launching the application via this GDesktopAppInfo will behave as expected, e.g. setting working directory from "Path=..." of desktop file etc. If this creation fails fallback to old method with its restriction, e.g. not setting the working directory etc.

    Workaround if loading themed icon via filename with extension is not supported by default
    
    In cases where _xfdashboard_image_content_load_from_icon_name() gets a filename with extension, e.g. "skype.png", and gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon() fails to lookup icon then fallback to lookup icon without extension. But before doing this lookup we check if gdk-pixbuf supports this file extension at any of its formats.

    Simplify checking visibility of a garcon menu element
    
    Just call get_visible() on a GarconMenuElement as it will do already all extensive checks if this element should be visible or not. There is no need to do our additional checks because they are already done. But we still have to count the number of visible sub-menus and menu items to determine if we should show or hide a menu.

    Do not list empty menus in application menu model
    
    To prevent listing empty menus we iterate through the menu items of a menu first and look if there is at least one visible (sub-)menu or menu item. If we do not find any visible ones we do not process this menu and do not add it to list of menus so it will not show up.

    Add support to prevent upscaling beyond real size in XfdashboardScaledTableLayout
    
    The layout manager XfdashboardScaledTableLayout got a new property called "prevent-upscaling" which is set to FALSE by default. This property manages if layout manager is allowed to scale a child larger than its real natural size or not. The windows view uses this new property and exports it by itself to allow windows to be scaled beyond their real size or not. As it is a stylable property it can be control by a theme.

    Warning: Massive API break because of renamed class and functions. Renamed XfdashboardImage to XfdashboardImageContent to keep class name in sync with naming convention I used so far (see XfdashboardWindowContent for a ClutterContent derived class and ClutterImage, which XfdashboardImage is derived from, is also a ClutterContent derived class). Also XfdashboardImage is now free e.g. for an actor utilizing XfdashboardImageContent.

    Initial implementation of focus manager

    Move stylable functions into an interface
    
    XfdashboardActor will not implement and provide styling possibilities but implements the new stylable interface (XfdashboardStylable). Moving the functionality into an interface gives us the opportunity to style non-actors also (anytime later).
    
    Why should non-actors be stylable by CSS? That's because non-actors like XfdashboardWindowContents or XfdashboardImage will be visible because they are used by (visible and drawn) actors. This is not implemented yet but prepared.

    Rename key in theme file from "LayoutPrimary" to "Layout"
    
    When writing documentation about how to layout xfdashboard I saw that is was not wise to name the key "LayoutPrimary". Because the key takes a list of file, separated by semicolon, there is no need to differ between layout files and their purposes. Only the attribute "id" of the object element which is the child of interface needs to set correctly.

Outline is now a effect which takes care that outline is drawn last and is always visible. Also a new property "outline-borders" (XfdashboardBackground) which "maps" to "borders" in new XfdashboardOutlineEffect class and manages which sides (and also which rounded corner) should be drawn.

    Added infrastructure for search providers. Registered search providers will be called each time a search is performed - either as full search or as incremental search to a previous one if each search term in new search is a prefix of its counterpart in new search and if their order did not change. Search provider can use any source for their search but have to create an actor for each item in their result if requested. The newly added search manager manages all search providers at one place. Search view was rewritten to use this new search infrastructure.

    Do not resize stage after window was opened
    
    This commit addresses issue #1. It seems that starting with clutter 1.16 the way how the stage window is created within clutter changed resulting that coordinates in stage window were transformed wrongly although there were no visible differences. By setting stage actor's size (and therefore window size) when actor is created and before window is created by clutter the right transformation was restored.

    Support to get stylable properties of requested class only or of all parent classes as well
    
    xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties is splitted into two functions: xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties and xfdashboard_actor_get_stylable_properties_full. The first one will fill the hashtable only with stylable properties of requested and the latter one will also get the stylable properties of all parent classes recursively.

    Using the new public function also in xfdashboard_actor_style_invalidate deduplicates code for creating hashtable holding references to parameter specifications. This also help to avoid missing changes at one place while the other place was changed because there is now only one place at all.

    Added support for theming xfdashboard. In addition it is now a requirement that least one theme is installed and referenced in xfconf at property /theme. A default theme named "xfdashboard" is included and used if xfconf property is not set. This theme is a copy of the previously hard coded style.

    Emit correct enter and leave events in XfdashboardDragAction
    
    As seen while fixing XfdashboardCollapseBox it is necessary to create and set up correct enter and leave events in XfdashboardDragAction to get handled correctly (at least by XfdashboardCollapseBox).

    Fix bug that XfdashboardCollapseBox collapse even if pointer device is still inside actor
    
    There are a few situations where only a "leave-event" signal without a following "enter-event" signal is emitted although the pointer is still inside the XfdashboardCollapseBox actor. So the actor is shrinked to minimum size accidently. This happens most when switching through workspaces. So we first check if the new target actor is a direct or deeper child of the collapse box and if it is not then we check if the actor under pointer device is a direct or deeper child. If both checks fails then the pointer device should be really outside the collapse box and it is allowed to shrink to minimum size.

    Added missing license in file COPYING
    
    If I understood the table at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility then I could not use any other license than GPL-2+ because all library I use (or better I link to) are LGPL-2.1 only or LGPL-2.1+ except for xfconf. xfconf might be GPL-2 only and incompatible to GPL-3 or its LGPL-2.1 only but compatible to GPL-3. xfconf mixes the "short license text" in source code and includes GPL-2 in COPYING. As long as I cannot determine the "real" license I use GPL-2 just in case.
    
    My thoughts are only valid if I understood the table and if linking to other libraries is "I want to use a library" (in context of table).

    This issue was caused by XfdashboardApplication because it set the suspend flag even in non-daemon mode which is read by XfdashboardWindowContent and forces removal of XDamage object from X windows. So it never received any update from X.

    Reload application menu model when menu changed
    
    By connecting to signal "reload-required" at each GarconMenu we get notified if menu structure or menu items changed (e.g. an application was installed or removed). The XfdashboardApplicationModel will then clear and (re-)load itself to get the new menu structure. After that it emits signal "loaded" (as it will on creation) to notify all handlers about (re-)load.

    Consider minimized window as visible ones.
    
    In real minimized windows are hidden but with additional flag "minimized". To distinguish between completely hidden window and just minimized window we check flag "minimized" additionally. Only if flag "hidden" is set and "minimized" flag is not set the window is recognized as hidden by application. Without this differentiation also minimized window will not show up in windows view and will not be selectable or restorable to previous state (a visible state) anymore. At least not via xfdashboard but via task switcher (ALT+Tab).

    Using XComposite and XDamage are optional dependencies but used automatically when libraries and headers were installed at build time. This was done automatically and you cannot influence this behaviour. Now the use of this optional features can be configure by using "--(enable/disable)-xcomposite" etc.

    This change should ensure that each remote instance will force the primary instance to resume (means show the stage window). Before this change g_application_activate() called from remote instance did not send the dbus signal to the primary instance or the signal did not reach the primary instance. Because of this the stage window was not (re-)shown reliable.

    We cannot assume that each window newly opened or moved to a workspace will be on top of all other windows. It highly depends on the window manager and personal settings. We need to respect window stacking. Therefore we iterate through list of windows in stacking order to find the last window the live workspace has an actor for before we the window requested to insert a new actor at this position or move an existing window actor to this position.

commit d0895e5919d6dfef58d9853cc8228969819fc3ea
Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Tue Dec 24 23:48:08 2013 +0100

    To prevent emiting our motion events in XfdashboardDragAction on actors being destroyed while drag is in progress (e.g. a window actor was destroyed because its window was closed) we connect to 'destroy' signal of each "motion actor" added to list. The signal handler will be removed either on actor's destruction by signal handler's callback, when pointer leaves actor or on end of drag.

    Actor must be one same stage where event happened when handling motion events for enter/leave/motion.

Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Tue Dec 24 16:00:53 2013 +0100

    Add new actor XfdashboardCollapseBox which holds (better: handles) only one child and acts like a expander. The stage puts XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector into such a collapse box to save space in stage. The workspace selector will then expand as soon as the pointer moves into it and will collapse when pointer moved out. XfdashboardDragAction has to handle and emit 'enter-event', 'leave-event' and 'motion-event' on its own because ClutterDragAction will turn off motion handling but it is needed to keep XfdashboardCollapseBox functional. That means the collapse box should still expand and collapse while a drag is in progress.

Doing it this way should provide a stable API for libwnck throughout all code and the only place to work with #ifdef's to work around changing libwnck API are the window tracker objects.

    Windows view should now really always fit into viewpad without scrollbars to flicker. There is caution to use the new enum XFDASHBOARD_FIT_MODE_BOTH as the view _MUST_ be able to scale itself to fit into allocation _ALWAYS_ otherwise it will be clipped without being able to scroll (as there are no scrollbars in this mode).

    Bad workaround for click action which prevents e.g. drag actions to work properly at least since clutter version 1.12. The click action will always win and "drag-begin" will never be emitted.
    
    This object/file is a complete copy of the original clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of clutter 1.12 except for one line, renamed function names and applied coding style. As the clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of later clutter versions do not differ much from this one this object is expected to work even in this versions.

    Until I added a property to XfdashboardApplicationsView to switch between list and icon mode and calling filter_changed signal handler explicitly I should move the code after the part which creates the layout manager for this view.

    Added new actor called XfdashboardApplicationButton which is a button but its text and icon to display is retrieved either by a GarconMenuElement or a GAppInfo. This actor can also the associated application defined by either one of them. The application view was modified to use them.

    Implemented applications menu model which collects menu entries via garcon library. It can be used to display menu entries in a view in different ways: all entries, all entries of a menu and by sections like games, office etc. Two helper functions will help to filter the entries by menu or section.
    
    Changed applications view to show applications menu entries instead of a clock ;) Clicking on a folder will show its contents but clicking on a menu item will start the associated application.
    
    Also improved view to allow to scroll to requested position.

    Implement action signal to scroll any view. The viewpad will react on scoll-to signals of any view (active or inactive ones) and scroll to requested position either by setting scrollbar values directly (if active view) or by updating clipping data (inactive views).

    Improved viewpad to allow fitting a view in one direction into viewpad. Therefore a new virtual function (*set_fit_mode) was added to abstract class XfdashboardView for reacting on fit mode changed in view (new type XfdashboardFitMode). Corrected scrollbar and clipping behaviour of viewpad.

Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Mon Aug 19 23:23:47 2013 +0200

    Implemented basic version of XfdashboardFitBoxLayout which layouts children like ClutterBoxLayout but takes care to fit into parent actor's width or height depending on orientation. It will alway set width or height of every child to match parent's size but it can scale it to keep aspect ratio if wanted. When implementing this layout manager also some minor errors and misbehaviours of some other actors were corrected (and hopefully throw no warnings or criticals anymore).

    Speed up scrolling because it got worse after speeding up search. The reason was that each time the scrollbar moved (value-changed signal emitted) all actors were re-allocated and re-layouted even the hidden ones. Speeding it up by just moving view and clipping of view but only it view has clipping.

As soon as I crossed an application icon in quicklaunch it stopped emitting signals to underlying quicklaunch. And implementing my own DropAction caused implementing my own DragAction which is derived from clutter's one.

    - Added base abstract class XfdashboardView which all views are derived from
    - Tried to clean up layout and using layout manager in a more correct way when setting up stage
    - Added a fill box layout manager which always expands an actor in the opposite direction as the actors laid out
    - Added viewpad which shows view selector and the active view. Currently scroll bars are always shown

    Set minimum version of external libraries as requirements to avoid using macros not available and makes handling different version a lot harder. BTW libwnck below 2.10 is
    very old and hardly in use nowadays so we can not support these versions. Also made compiler more quiet with -std=gnu99 but should be still warn.
