    Create safe function replacement for clutter_actor_get_allocation_box()
    
    Calling clutter_actor_get_allocation_box() is dangerous with animation because it may modify the internal state of the position and size of an actor used for initial values for position and size at the animation to run. Therefore this safe function exists which returns the last allocation set to this actor.

    Seems that I completed my "more-than-one-year-of-headache" mission no. Animation for move and/or resize (via allocation) should work now. Note to me: Maybe the layout manager need some love now to respect fixed positions at least.

    Following main Xfce project by switching to "foreign" mode for automake
    
    - This way, we don't need to provide a README file, now that we start to
      switch to README.md for markdown readme on gitlab
    - "[..] differences between the gnu and foreign flavours is
      that the former requires the presence of a number of files in the
    top-level of the projects": https://autotools.io/automake/options.html
    - It also stop warning when using GNU make syntax, but we already
      mandate gnu make, so it's not a problem

    Add an invalid desktop file for a desktop ID to application database to prevent that a valid desktop file for the same desktop ID will be found at path of lower prioritory which will then be store in the database as no entry exists at that point of time. The first entry found - valid or invalid - has the highest priority. Later all invalid desktop IDs in the application database are removed before populated.
    
    Should fix the expected behaviour at GH #169

    Add signal 'style-revalidated' to interface XfdashboardStylable
    
    This signal is emitted when the style information for a XfdashboardStylable derived object was invalidated and the new style information was calculated and applied. This signal is mostly useful for stylable (inheriting XfdashboardStylable interface) non-actor (no sub-class of #XfdashboardActor) objects to also invalidate their style information and to get them recalculated and applied if they depend on the stylable object which emitted the signal. Connected XfdashboardDynamicTableLayout layout manager to this signal.

    The default behaviour how bindings are loaded has been changed. Previsouly it tried to the first bindings configuration file from these location (in this order): The full path defined at environment variable XFDASHBOARD_BINDINGS_POOL_FILE (if debug mode was enable at configure script), the user's configuration folder (usually $HOME/.config/xfdashboard) and at last the system-wide folder. Now it tries to laod the system-wide one first, then the one at user's configuration folder and merges all bindings loaded from there to the one already loaded. At last it check if the environment variable is set (no need for debug mode anymore) and loads the bindings from this file and merges them.

    An active pop-up menu did not get notified when a daemonized instance was suspended. The result was that if the application resumed, the pop-up menu was still active. But that is not expected by the user. So cancel pop-up menu now when application suspends.

    Implement fallback code path to get application actions of a desktop entry
    
    Garcon prior to version 0.6.0 does not provide accessor function for application actions of a desktop entry and the first version providing these function returns the action in an unpredictable order but not the order as listed in "Action" keyword of desktop entry. So we need to load the secondary source and grab them ourselve.
    
    The secondary source in XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo is called so although it is the same file as used for GarconMenuItem. But it is not the same source because the file is loaded via a GKeyFile object to get access to entries not provided by garcon or implemented in an unusable way for xfdashboard.

    * If this option is used and no instance is running, show version and quit
    * If this option is used and an instance is running (usually the daemon) then show version of xfdashboard executed with this option is the terminal where it is executed and the daemon is show in the terminal (or in ~/.xsession-errors) where the daemon is runnning
    
    It is really a very simple version requesting option.

    Revert commit 1b02280bb6999d3c68f8fdaa25a1cde5e428ec0b as it renders pop-up menu at application buttons in quicklaunch unreachable.
    
    This commit moved pop-up menus being shown only on left-clicks (and touchscreen taps) instead of right clicks and the left click is first handled by application button activation event handler, usually starting the application and quitting xfdashboard. So pop-up menus are never reached.
    
    Reverting this commit turns on right-clicks again.

    Add correct marshaler signature to marshal.list and usage of closure in XfdashboardSearchResultContainer::item-clicked as variants have their own type for generation by glib-genmarshal. Declaring a variant as object may cause closure assertion at some systems and item-clicked signals are not emitted anymore which then cause problems in activation in search results.

    Fix function to lookup X11 window from GDK window for a ClutterStage in GDK backend
    
    When xfdashboard is run in daemon mode the stage window will be created on first visible state. That means that looking up GDK window for a stage will return NULL at start-up until the stage is shown for the very first time. When iterating through the stages and determining GDK windows we need to respect this, otherwise xfdashboard crashes in daemon mode at start-up when resolving a NULL pointer of GDK window to a X11 window ID (XID).

    Add compile-time checked support for xfconf version 4.12.x (called legacy here) and xfconf 4.13.x.
    
    When using newer xfconf 4.13.x string arrays could not be retrieved anymore via a GPtrArray provided by dbus-glib but native GPtrArray gtype can be used. That means in addition that - when using xfconf 4.13.x - we can get rid of dbus-glib. So make dbus-glib optional and check for it only if xfconf 4.12.x was found and used in configure script

    Additional check for Clutter backend
    
    Added additional check for Clutter backends, i.e. GDK backend. These check are needed because at least FreeBSD (and maybe NetBSD) do not have this Clutter backend. These checks will automatically recognize if this backend is available and will enable support for it in xfdashboard.

    Changed the way and order how CSS files of themes are loaded:
    
    - First the CSS resources define in theme's theme file (xfdashboard.theme) are loaded
    - Then user's global stylesheet ($HOME/.config/xfdashboard/themes/global.css) is loaded if it exists
    - At last user's theme related stylesheet ($HOME/.config/xfdashboard/themes/user-[THEME_NAME].css) is loaded if it exists
    
    This commit addresses issue GH #152 to make user's changes to one or all themes more convienient.

    This reverts commit 1b240ff21e31c788c9a74438e2e04621db0f26ce.
    
    The workaround will not work regardless what I try. I do not know if I could blame the X11 backend of Clutter but it is strange that a second call to clutter_actor_show() will never show the stage in fullscreen although the size of the window seems to be correct for fullscreen.
    
    I think other window managers have to wait for a GDK backend at xfdashboard. :(

    Revert commit 2e676ddf96b378ad758fe2724c9830359529044f and add signal handler which also tracks if the stage window was closed to reconnect the signal handler for "window-opened" to find new stage window. This way the XfdashboardStage object should always know its window regardless if just hidden or destroyed and recreated.

    Does not work because the window representing the stage will be destroyed and gets invalid so a second call to *_show_stage() will fail with an assertion about an invalid XfdashboardWindowTrackerWindow object. :(

    Instead of window functions which just turn a window into stage window, it should handle it completely from setting it up to showing it. In addition the function to "unmake" a stage window should also hide the window directly. Because of this change in functionality the function were renamed.

It should also always respect the view specified via --view command-line parameter first and then the configure one in the setting in all cases.

    Fix order of newly created window actor at XfdashboardLiveWorkspace by iterating the window stacking order in reversed order to find the index to place new window actor at. This fixes the issue that a moved window from another workspace to a new workspace will not show the window as it will place it above the first window which has an actor at the target XfdashboardLiveWorkspace actor but not above the last window actor as the comment said so it was invisible although the window is above all other windows in real.

    Implemented enhancements to layout xml file to specify which actor of the focusable ones should be selected on theme load. The following changes were applied:
    
    - Added a new optional attribute to <focus>, a sub-node of <focusables>, in layout xml files called "selected". This attribute "selected" is a boolean attribute and expects to be set to either "true" or "false". If set to "true" this actor will be selected instead of the search box. If set to "false" it has no impact and handled as this attribute does not exist.
    - The new optional attribute "selected" of <focus> is optional. If not used at all the old behaviour, selecting the search box by default, applies.
    - The new optional attribute "selected" of <focus> should only be used once over all layout xml files. A warning will be printed if it used more than once but the theme will load successfully.
    - Removed unfocuable actor "view-selector" from primary stage interface layout
    - Improved code at XfdashboardStage to use weak references instead of connecting signal which get called when actor is destroyed to set reference pointers to NULL
    - Modified packaged theme to use new theme possibilities
    - Fixed typos

    It seems that newer Glib version do better check marshal parameters and now recognize that I have specified the wrong type of G_TYPE_OBJECT at signal actions for the event parameter. ClutterEvent is a boxed type (G_TYPE_BOXED) and therefore the marshal parameter must be corrected to it.

But also classes like XfdashboardActor can be set in this environment variable to debug a specific class. Classes are case-sensitive and must be in camel-case. You can mix categories and classes in enviroment variable. You can set multiple categories and/or classes to debug by separating them by commas.

    Add debug messages about which images are still in cache and not released to XfdashboardImageContent

    Only load images at XfdashboardImageContent if actor to which this content is attached is mapped.
    
    If it is not mapped defer loading image until the actor is mapped. As the content could be attached to more than one actor the first known actor being mapped will trigger loading the image and disconnecting signal handlers from all other actors.

    Remove functions xfdashboard_live_workspace_get_show_window_content() and xfdashboard_live_workspace_set_show_window_content() from XfdashboardLiveWorkspace because it needed to be themed before via 'show-window-content' property and can now be themed via 'display-type' property of XfdashboardLiveWindowSimple.
    
    Just replace the following CSS:
    
    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace
    {
      show-window-content: <true or false>;

    XfdashboardLiveWorkspace XfdashboardLiveWindowSimple

    Next attempt to allow overriding draw function of background borders and corner, e.g. interesting for popup-menus to draw an arrow on any side of background
    
    This time XfdashboardBackground connects to "draw" signal of ClutterCanvas used to draw background (filled with a color and with rounded or not) and proxies this signal through itself. It also provides a virtual function (*draw_background) which will be called if set. That function has to return TRUE if it handled the painting of background canvas and FALSE if not. If no virtual function was set, XfdashboardBackground will return FALSE to get the next signal handler to draw the outline getting called (which is usually the default signal handler of XfdashboardBackground with the original code).
    
    Also typos were fixed :)

    Next attempt to allow overriding draw function of background borders and corner, e.g. interesting for popup-menus to draw an arrow on any side of outline
    
    This time the XfdashboardOutlineEffect provides a "draw" signal to paint the outline because the original code is the default signal handler.
    
    Next XfdashboardBackground connects to this new signal of XfdashboardOutlineEffect to proxy this signal through itself. It also provides a virtual function (*draw_outline) which will be called if set. That function has to return TRUE if it handled the painting of outline and FALSE if not. If no virtual function was set, XfdashboardBackground will return FALSE to get the next signal handler to draw the outline getting called (usually the default signal handler of XfdashboardOutlineEffect).

So rename signal "theme-changing" to "theme-loading" and add new signal "theme-loaded" to application which is emitted after loading theme is complete but not yet applied. It is the last chance for a plugin to load additional resources (CSS etc.), e.g. to override theme's CSS.

    Differ between "clicked" which is usually associated to a left-click and a "click" with any other button at XfdashboardClickAction.
    
    Therefore the signals "clicked" and "long-press" at XfdashboardClickAction are only emitted if the click was done with the left button. To get clicks with any other the new signals "button-clicked" and "long-button-press" are emitted (also for left-clicks) which tranfer also the button which was clicked.
    
    This changes the default behaviour of XfdashboardClickAction but should interfer with the current behaviour as left-clicks were assumed so far.

    Add flags to XfdashboardPlugin to define behaviours of plugin which can only be set once via xfdashboard_plugin_set_info() and only while loading.
    
    Currently only early initialization of plugin can be requested so the plugin gets enabled on load, that means before theme is loaded and application's stage is created and set up. The default behaviour of plugins now is to get enabled after stage was created and set up.

    Emit new signal "initialized" in XfdashboardApplication if it is the primary instance and fully initialized, that means all managers and the stage were set up successfully.
    
    The main purpose for this signal is for plugin which need to initialize after application is fully initialized and all components are available, initialized and ready for use.

    Clean up xfdashboard_notify() not to iterate through all actors by itself and supporting multiple stages (as only one stage exists) but use new xfdashboard_traverse_actor() function.
    
    Ideally we could even stop using xfdashboard_traverse_actor() function as one stage exists so we could use xfdashboard_application_get_stage() directly. But maybe sometime we use XfdashboardStageInterface (which exists for each monitor) to send notifications so it is easier to modify this code instead of re-implementing it.

    This function is mainly useful for plugin which need to find actors to modify them when this plugin was enabled specially after a long the application has already run and stage was setup.

    This signal is emitted for the very first time a new actor gets its parent set and so it is the first time the actor belongs to UI and - from point of view of application - it exists now / was created. The main purpose of this signal is for plugins to react on newly created actor to filter and/or modify them and/or to connect signals. E.g. a plugin wants to connect a signal to each XfdashboardButton in XfdashboardQuicklaunch, so it has to listen for 'actor-created' signals at stage, then filter all actors for XfdashboardButtons whose parent is XfdashboardQuicklaunch. Then it can go on with its work.

    Move to workspace where the window to activate (by clicking it in windows view) is placed on if it is on a different workspace than the active one.
    
    This only happens in windows view if 'filter-workspace-windows' is set to FALSE. The default value is TRUE so this code path is usually not run.

    Allow windows view not only to filter windows which are only on current monitor (via themable property 'filter-monitor-windows') but also for windows on current workspace via a new themable property called 'filter-workspace-windows'. This new option is set to TRUE by default so that all themes will still work as they did before.

    Fix unpredictable reselections of result items in search view when the current selection was destroyed or hidden while updating results.
    
    We check if the current selection is the first selectable item at the provider result container which contains the current selection _before_ updating the results. If it is the first selectable then remember the selection and the provider containing the selection. After updating the results we check if the current selection now is still the same as before updating result. If the selection has changed and we knew which provider contained the old selection then we select the first selectable item at provider's result container.

    Implement our own model class and replace ClutterModel with new XfdashboardModel because ClutterModel is deprecated since Clutter version 1.24.

    Silence compiler warning about using deprecated actor state access macros by using functions introduced with Clutter 1.23.4
    
    We update the source code to use state access functions, e.g. clutter_actor_is_visible(), instead of the old macros, e.g. CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_VISIBLE(). But also implement a compatibility layer which "redirects" functions to macros again when compiling and linking against Clutter older than 1.23.4.
    
    This is the first fix for issue GH #117

    Rewrote application class and main() function to make use of main loop in g_application_run() which is needed since Glib 2.47.4+ because it will deregister application from D-BUS as soon as this function exits. So the old implementation does not "see" any running instance (regardless if running as daemon or not) anymore and cannot neither quit nor restart the running instance. So several instances can run simultaneously, e.g. two daemon instances, instead of toggling the state of application.

I tried to use the calculation of current, revision and age for this library version information as GTK+ does. I really hope it make sense and works ... on all platforms.

    Ensure view is visible when allocation changes and scrollbar ranges might have changed.
    
    Scrollbar ranges might get smaller, e.g. in search view when view is greater than viewpad and a new search is started. Then only the scrollbar ranges are adjusted to new size but view's clipping is not. This commit should ensure that the clipping is adjusted to position of scrollbars.

    Do not set allocation on container within the layout manager's allocation function at XfdashboardDynamicTableLayout.
    
    That is a nasty bug as it will call the allocation function recursive in an infinite loop because setting the allocation on the container will call the layout manager's allocation function again and again and again ...

    Add hot-corner plugin
    
    This is a plugin of the "other" category as it does not extend xfdashboard with any new views or search providers. It will check the pointer position and if it stays in an configured hot-corner (currently statically set to top-left corner) for a configured time interval (currently statically set to 350ms) it will switch the application's state. That means it will suspend the application if is active at that moment or activate it if was suspended. To do this xfdashboard must be running in daemon mode.

    Ensure that minimized flag is not set besides the maximized flags at window to consider it is maximized.
    
    In my point of view it should be an error when the minimized flag is set along with the (both) flags for being maximized. But maybe it is just not a good name and it should be a 'hide' flag instead of 'minimized' flag. Then it makes sense that all these flags at set at once and we have to check additionally that the minimized (hide) flag is *not* set to consider that window is maximized.

    Allow configuration how matching applications are sorted when searching. This behaviour is controlled via an unsigned integer property called "/components/applications-search-provider/match-mode" in channel "xfdashboard" at Xfconf which represents a flag.
    
    The default is "none" (with value zero) which is the old behaviour by just sorting them by title in alphabetical order. It is possible to sort them by relevance or score (with value one) and/or number of application launches (with value two).

    Implement a new actor in XfdashboardLiveWorkspace showing the workspace's name
    
    This new actor is hidden by default but can be turned on at a theme. The workspace name actor gets the class ".title" added so that the actor (a XfdashboardButton) can also be themed.

    Check that fill canvas is set when allocating XfdashboardBackground actor.
    
    At some circumstances that variable was not set (anymore?) and critical messages of clutter_canvas_set_size about CLUTTER_IS_CANVAS() failures were thrown. Maybe that XfdashboardBackground was already disposed which causes the fill canvas object to be destroyed but the allocation function was called anyway. Checking the pointer should silence this warnings ;)

    Allow a search provider to initialize after property 'provider-id' is set. The property 'provider-id' is set on object creation but after *_class_init and *_init function of object class and inherited classes are called. So the provider's *_init function cannot rely on this property to initialize early. So the search manager calls the overidable initialize function if it was set in *_class_init function.

    Split function to determine desktop ID via environment variables from PID of newly opened windows in application tracker into operating system dependent functions.
    
    The current implementation does not respect the operating system for which is was compiled. It is assumed that a proc filesystem does exist and provides a file at /proc/$PID/environ. But this is only true for Linux but not for *BSD systems. To support *BSD (if anyone using a BSD system would implement it) different operating system and their specific way to retrieve environment variables of a process the originate function was split into a independent and an OS-specified function. The OS-specific function for Linux was converted with this commit as the independent function was cleaned up. The OS-specific function will be compiled depending on which condition via #if defined(__XXX___) succeeds.
    
    A fallback "OS-depending" function also exist just printed a warning once that this system is unsupported.

    Implemented a new actor XfdashboardActionButton
    
    The new actor XfdashboardActionButton is a button and derived from XfdashboardButton. It perform an action on a specified target actor class when clicked. It is configured similar to a (key) binding - see bindings.xml - and behaves similar but is reduced to a target and an action. E.g. if a XfdashboardActionButton is added to a layout (xfdashboard.xml) a target like "XfdashboardFocusManager" with action "focus-move-next" can be defined which will move the focus to next registered focusable actor like the default key "Tab" in bindings.xml
    
    This implementation closes issues GH #102

    Allow mouse wheel to change workspace in windows view at any pointer position
    
    The current behaviour of the setting "/components/windows-view/scroll-event-changes-workspace" is to change workspace if pointer is over the windows view (and only there) when the mouse wheel is used.
    
    This behaviour was changed to allow the pointer to be anywhere on a monitor with an active windows view when the mouse wheel is used. Using the default theme that means that in a single monitor setup the windows view must be active to change workspace with mouse wheel (and enabled setting "/components/windows-view/scroll-event-changes-workspace" of course). The pointer can be anywhere: quicklaunch, search text box etc. In a multi-monitor setup the requirements of a single-monitor also affects the primary monitor in this setup but at all non-primary monitor is will always work if the pointer is at a non-primary monitor as it will only show a windows view ;)

    Re-add support for environment variable XFDASHBOARD_FORCE_NEW_INSTANCE
    
    This environment variable can be set to any value as it needs only to exist. But it is only checked if xfdashboard is compiled with debug support.
    
    If this enviroment variable is set to any value then it spawn a new instance of xfdashboard regardless if any other instance is already running. This is interesting to test a new compile of xfdashboard for debugging purposes while (a stable) xfdashboard instance is running in background in daemonized mode.

    Implemented a basic and simple plugin system
    
    This commit is huge as it implements a basic and simple plugin system as well a sample plugin adding a new view showing a clock when this plugin is enabled. By default the plugin manager does not load anything as it looks at the property "/enabled-plugin" in channel "xfdashboard" of xfconf which is empty by default. The plugin manager expects an array of string at this property whereby each string in this array contains the name of the plugin to load, e.g. "clock-view" for the sample clock view plugin.
    
    The plugin are searched in the following search paths in this order: the path at the environment variable XFDASHBOARD_PLUGINS_PATH (if set), $HOME/.local/share/xfdashboard/plugins, (install prefix)/lib/xfdashboard/plugins.
    
    The sample plugin can be tested by enabling it with the command (you should add parameter "-n" to xfconf-query at the beginning at the first time):
    xfconf-query -c xfdashboard -p /enabled-plugins -a -s clock-view -t string
    
    To disable all plugins use:
    xfconf-query -c xfdashboard -r -p /enabled-plugins
    
    Currently the plugin manager does not listen to changes at this property in xfconf so it does not load or unload any plugin automatically at changes. The application has to be restarted.

    Introduce a new CSS class which will be added to XfdashboardSearchResultContainer. The CSS class name is build with a prefix "search-provider-id-" followed by the search provider's ID (like "applications" for XfdashboardApplicationsSearchProvider used by applications search provider) - so the complete CSS class name would be ".search-provider-id-applications" (for use in CSS) in this case.

    Rewrote search manager to use IDs.
    
    Remember: The idea was to also support multi-purpose search providers. This kind of search provider register themselve several times with different IDs. They can determine their purpose by reading the ID and behave different depending on the ID. E.g. a Gnome Shell search provider will be created once for each different search provider installed but with different ID specifying which search provider is meant. They could then enabled and disabled seperately. E.g. "gnome-shell-search-provider-net.sacredchao.QuodLibet.SearchProvider" could create an instance of GnomeShellSearchProvider but searches only songs in QuodLibet and "gnome-shell-search-provider-org.gnome.seahorse.Application" would search keys and certificates in seahorse etc.

    Rewrote view manager to use IDs.
    
    Views do not specify their internal names by themselve but are now registered with an ID directly and the GType of this view is registered with this ID. Doing it this way makes it possible to define multi-purpose views of the same type. This is not interesting for views but for search providers.
    
    Multi-purpose views (and later search providers) can reuse the same type but behave different depending on the ID. Thinking of one Gnome shell search provider object that will be registered several time but with different ID whereby the ID specifies with search provider to call via DBUS. This is just an example.

    Consider desktop files in sub-directories if not found via the application name directly
    
    If we cannot find an matching application from any window name (instance name, class name etc.) directly in application database consider it may located in a sub-directory, e.g. kile in kde4 resulting in a desktop file called 'kde4-kile.desktop'. Then create a glob pattern '*-<<NAME>>' and iterate through all registered applications in application database collecting all matching the glob pattern. If the resulting list contains exactly one application it should be the one we're looking for.

    Since GTK+ version 3.10 the setting "gtk-tooltip-timeout" is deprecated and ignored by GTK+ derived application. So we should behave the same and set the timeout statically to the default duration which GTK+ is also using.
    
    This also prevents warning about forthcoming deprecation of this setting printed to console.

    Add command-line option "--view"
    
    The command-line option "--view [internal name of view]" allows to specify which view to show when xfdashboard gets visible once. It "overrides" any view configured in settings.

    Implement function to allow a single-time switch to another view on resume as configured in settings or to switch to a view at initial start-up.
    
    The view name set must be the internal view name of the view to switch to. This "switch" will only performed once, that means after the switch the name set will be resetted and the configured view in the settings will be considered again.
    
    This commit is part of implementation needed to fix bug #12144

    Let function xfdashboard_notify() match documentation ;)
    
    The documentation say that xfdashboard_notify() will lookup stage of primary monitor if no sending actor is specified but it did only lookup default or first stage. Now we iterate through all stages to lookup the one of primary monitor first and then fallback to old behaviour.

    Implement basic application tracker
    
    The application tracker tries to determine and to keep track of running application. It does it by in two ways currently for each new window opened.
    
    1.) Parse the environment variables of the process ID which own the window. If it has the environment variables GIO_LAUNCHED_DESKTOP_FILE and GIO_LAUNCHED_DESKTOP_FILE_PID and GIO_LAUNCHED_DESKTOP_FILE_PID matches the process ID of the window's owner process then it assumed that the application in GIO_LAUNCHED_DESKTOP_FILE is running. This step only work at Linux currently.
    2.) Get some properties from the window (resource class etc.), add '.desktop' to the value and try to lookup a matching application in XfdashboardApplicationDatasbase, first with unmodified value and then in all lower-case.
    
    This commit implements a first version for GH #39

    Make new experimental code to create and resume window content in an idle source configurable in settings application also

    New experimental code to create and resume window content in an idle source is working well so make it configurable via a xfconf property called "/window-content-creation-priority".
    
    The following values are valid: immediate, high, normal and low. The value 'immediate' will create the window content for each window at the time it was requested which is the default behaviour known so far. This value ('immediate') is also the default value if property was not set or set to an invalid value. The other values how fast and the number of window content textures should be created application is idle. While 'high' tries to create as many window content textures as possible, the values 'normal' and 'low' will create much less.

    Improve detection if tooltip should be shown
    
    Previously the tooltip action only recognized to hide a tooltip if it was shown but it did not recognize not to show a tooltip if a interupting event (like button press) happened before the tooltip was shown at all. This commit fixes it and the tooltip should behave even more likely like a GTK+ tooltip now.

    Add experimental delayed window content creation
    
    To make application "feel" faster on machines with slow graphics card (slow texture creation and/or uploading) a resume queue was implemented which will create the window texture in an idle source once at a time. This should help not to block the application at start-up or when switching to workspaces with many windows resulting in a "feeling" that the application is faster.
    
    This implementation is experimental so a #define must be set and the debug message will be printed regardless if G_MESSAGES_DEBUG is set or not. Once the implementation is stable the message will printed with g_debug() instead of g_message().

    Improve search responsiveness by delaying initial search
    
    Instead of performing a search with the first keystroke we will now create a timeout source now. When the timeout is reached the initial search with the latest entered search term is performed. Further searches will not be delayed and performed immediately until the search term is empty or the search view is resetted.
    
    The timeout interval to delay the initial is configurable by property "/components/search-view/delay-search-timeout" and expects an unsinged integer describe the timeout interval in milliseconds.

    Windows view should handle windows moved to workspace it currently shows
    
    For example if a workspace is removed while xfdashboard is running it may happen that the windows placed at the removed workspace are moved to the workspace the windows view shows currently. So connect to "window-workspace-changed" globally to get notified.
    
    This commit fixes GH #91

    Try not to eat up CPU ... again!
    
    Do not emit 'window-geometry-changed' signals when application was suspended because there will be no visual changes. It is unneccessary to handle this signal.
    
    Instead disconnect signal handler to 'geometry-changed' from windows at window tracker if the application is suspended and reconnect them if application resumes. Because we track the window's last position and size we emit a 'window-geometry-changed' for each window at application resume when it has been moved or resized in the meantime.
    
    This should lower CPU usage while application is suspended and a window is moved or resized.

    Implement signal to notify if a window has moved to another monitor
    
    Implement a new signal 'window-monitor-changed' at window tracker to signal that a window has moved from one monitor to another. This is done by tracking the last position and size to determine the old monitor where this window was placed. If the new position and size of this window is at another monitor this new signal is emitted.
    
    This signal is used by the windows view to determine if the moved window has to stay in this view or if another window view instance has to create an actor for this window and to handle it.
    
    This new signal is only useful in multi-monitor setups.

    Added a themable property 'background-image-type' which behave like the property 'background-image-type' at XfdashboardStage(Interface). If set to 'desktop' it will show the desktop's background at the workspace (e.g. as used in workspace selector).

    Add property 'padding' to XfdashboardEmblemEffect
    
    This property adds padding to the emblem. Technically a margin at the actor is logically added and reduces the space of the actor at the border by the value of padding. Another explaination is that this property adds an additional offset (next to the alignment) to the emblem position.

    Implement a box layout manager XfdashboardBoxLayout derived from ClutterBoxLayout which uses all functions of derived class but disregards text direction settings. It forces always left-to-right text direction when layouting children horizontal.
    
    This fixes issue #66 at GitHub.

    Always check if window is on workspace in windows view
    
    Previously it was check if a workspace is set at windows view and if it was then it was check if windows is on workspace. If a workspace was not set it was assumed that window is visible. This resulted in creating a window actor for each window at start-up which. After start-up a workspace was set which caused all window actor to be destroyed and for all windows which are now on the workspace set were recreated. This delayed start-up because lots of window actor had to be created twice.
    
    Now we assume a window to be hidden if a workspace is not set because if windows view don't know the workspace no window could match it. This reduces start-up time a lot because no window actor is created twice but only once and creating window textures is a time consuming task.

    Replace dependency on libwnck-1.0 (minimum version 2.30) with libwnck-3.0 (minimum version 3.0)
    
    We depend on GTK+3 (version 3.2 or higher) in settings application and for some GTK+ functions in xfdashboard but we also depend on libwnck for window handling. Using libwnck-1.0 triggers to include GDK2 from GTK+2 resulting in a mix of GTK+ 2 and 3 what is really bad although it seems to work pretty well. In order to not mix both major GTK+ and to depend only on one GTK+ version the minimum version of libwnck had to raised up to 3.0 and since then we had to depend on libwnck-3.0 instead of libwnck-1.0.

    Implementing XfdashboardApplicationDatabase
    
    XfdashboardApplicationDatabase is a new class combining all sources for applications. It wraps the GarconMenu instance for the root menu which contains all sub-menus and menu item. It also provides a cache for all installed applications via their desktop files whereby user overridden desktop files have higher priority than system-wide installed desktop files. Also file monitors for each directory will be created to keep track of modifications to either the desktop files or directories. It can see when a new user created desktop file overrides a system-wide desktop file and vice versa - keeping track of them in a cache accessible via the desktop ID. Modifications, overrides or restored (means user-defined desktop file is deleted and system-wide desktop file is the one again) will emit the "change" signal on XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo instances to notify any actor, connected to this signal, that the appearance should be checked and adjusted to the modified file.

    Impleting XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo
    
    XfdashboardDesktopAppInfo is a new class wrapping a GarconMenuItem and a string for the desktop ID and it also implements the GAppInfo interface. So it can be used - more or less - as a drop-in replacement for GDesktopAppInfo. Each function of GAppInfo interface is implemented except for function regarding to mime type associations. This class wraps GarconMenuItem to gain all it's advantages over GDesktopAppInfo, e.g. supporting desktop file of type "Link" to start a web-browser with the url specified in desktop file. It also forwards the "changed" signal of GarconMenuItem (if it did set up a file monitor for it) to notify about changes to the menu item and the desktop file. So an actor could adjust its appearing to the changes made.
    
    This class also has an advance lookup function for desktop IDs containing dashes. It should find a desktop file for nearly any possible combination of a dash being a directory separator or being part of the file/directory name.

    Raise minimum version of Glib and GIO to 2.32
    
    Using macros like G_SOURCE_* too often but they were introduced with version 2.32 of Glib so raise minimum version to version 2.32. Also include checking for GLib in configure.ac.in and include CFLAGS and LIBS of GLib in Makefile.am although GIO should pull them in. This should harden the build system again build errors and mistakes.

    Fix build system
    
    Respect configure options --[enable/disable]-xcomposite and --[enable/disable]-xdamage by checking if X11 extensions exist _AND_ set variables for Makefile to include necessary include paths and needed libs depending on the configure option.
    
    Before I just checked the existence of required packages but nothing more. This means that enabling any of both extension was requested at 'configure' but clutter was not compiled with this extension the build must fail because the required header files and libraries were not be include because I did not add them in Makefile explicitly. I was relying on Clutter to be built with this extension and pulling them in.

    Hopefully this solves issue #69

    Hotkey tracker could loose new focus and will never be able to "reconnect" to focus events to restore tracking capabilitites. Once the new focus is lost the hotkey will not function anymore. Therefore also reset focus when the active window changes to re-setup event notifications.

    Add hotkey tracker
    
    The hotkey tracker will watch all key events globally and toggle application state when hotkey was recognized. Toggling means suspending application if is currently active or resuming application if not. Currently the hotkey is haard-coded to left Super key and right Super key.
    
    Reacting to hotkey presses is disabled by default. It has to be enabled by setting Xfconf's property "/hotkey-enabled" to boolean TRUE.
    
    The hotkey tracker is only usable in daemon mode but works also when running standalone. In the last case it will quit xfdashboard if hotkey is pressed but it cannot activate xfdashboard (because therefore it needs to be running in daemon mode otherwise the needed code is not running ;) )

    Add "--restart" option to command-line to restart application
    
    This option can used to restart daemon after an update - for example. But "--daemon" must be given also, otherwise a stand-alone version would be started.
    
    I know it was done a little bit complicated but I think it handles nearly all kinds of restart possibilities.

    Allow icon of search provider in search view result container to be themable
    
    This is achieved by adding two items.
    
    The first one is a themable property named "icon" in XfdashboardSearchResultContainer which expects a string with a themed icon name or a filename of the icon to display.
    
    The second one is a CSS class which will be added to XfdashboardSearchResultContainer. The CSS class name is build with a prefix "search-provider-" followed by the search provider's object name (like XfdashboardApplicationsSearchProvider for the applications search provider) - so the complete CSS class name would be ".search-provider-XfdashboardApplicationsSearchProvider" (for use in CSS) in this case.

    Allow scroll events in windows view to change active workspace
    
    Like XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector the windows view should change active workspace on scroll event, e.g. mouse-wheel up or down. But it should be configurable so a new xfconf property "/components/windows-view/scroll-event-changes-workspace" was introduced which is a boolean value to indicate if it should change active workspace on scroll events (value is TRUE) or not (value is FALSE)..
    
    This fixes issue #41

    Add more bindable actions
    
    Views can now be activated and focused (at once - simultaneously) but only if attribute "allow-unfocusable-targets" is set to true or 1 in bindings configuration file.
    
    If attribute "allow-unfocusable-targets" is set to true or 1 it indicates that also unfocusable actor should be included when resolving targets. It should be used with caution because it needs the action function to set focusable state of actor to be true.

    Split bindings into two seperate classes: bindings pool and binding
    
    By splitting XfdashboardBindings into two seperate classes XfdashboardBinding (a keyboard or pointer binding) and XfdashboardBindingsPool (a collection of bindings with actions associated) the code should be easier to read, to maintain and to extent.

    Implement key-bindings configuration
    
    Implemented a new configuration option. The application uses now a dynamic keyboard binding configuration instead of hard-coded key bindings like key 'Left' for select the item left of the currently selected item in a focusable actor. The configuration file is a XML file describing type of binding (although only key bindings are supported yet), the keycode and modifiers for the binding and the source and the action signal to perform when this key combination (of keycode and modifiers) are pressed or released at the actor specified.
    
    The application lookups up first a user-defined keyboard binding configuration file at 'xfdashboard/bindings.xml' the user's configuration folder which is ${HOME}/.config/xfdashboard/bindings.xml usually. If the file is not found at this path it looks up a system-wide keyboard configuration file which is a default one installed by xfdashboard, usually at /usr/share/xfdashboard/bindings.xml.

    Fix critical warning when focused selection get unavailable

    Apply new theme while running application
    
    This commit addresses and should fix issue #59. Rewrote XfdashboardApplication and XfdashboardStage to reload theme when xfconf property 'theme-name' changes. This introduces XfdashboardStageInterface as top-level actor for a stage (screen).
    
    Sadly this also breaks current theme API. All references in CSS and XML files to class XfdashboardStage have to be replaced to XfdashboardStageInterface. The new actor XfdashboardStageInterface shares the same stylable properties as XfdashboardStage and all changes to XfdashboardStageInterface will be applied to XfdashboardStage on-the-fly. So XfdashboardStageInterface is a one-to-one in-place replacement for XfdashboardStage.
    
    It is not the nicest solution as I wanted it to be but it could also be a preparation work for multi-monitor support (issue #14).

    Ensure right size of window actor and window content
    
    XfdashboardLiveWindow determines its size from XfdashboardWindowContent which either returns the size of the corresponding window if fallback is used or size of window content texture if fallback is not used. If application is suspended (and also all XfdashboardWindowContent objects) and it resumes the texture still returns the old size even if the window was resized in the meantime. This fix ensures that XfdashboardWindowContent returns window's real size if fallback is used (like before) or if it is suspended (that's new) otherwise it returns the size of window content texture (like before).
    
    This fix addresses issue #54

    More fixes for global line offset when importing external CSS files

    Forget to adjust global line offset before parsing CSS file going to be imported

commit d9375a17b3a3545679529c5eaba1169597fed095
Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Sun Nov 16 16:38:39 2014 +0100

    Adjust line of selector's source to a global line offset
    
    This is needed because an imported CSS file via @import(...) will start at line 1 although it is included virtually into the current CSS file at the line where @import is issued. So the imported CSS file and all following lines in the current CSS file need to be adjusted. That is what the global line offset is for. This corrects sorting matching selectors when priority is equal and the line in file where the matching selector is checked (see _xfdashboard_theme_css_sort_by_score).

    Implement '@import' function in CSS
    
    The @import function allows to import other CSS styles from other files. The syntax is: @import(filename). The filename can be an absolute or relative path. The filename should be quoted with either by single or double quotation marks but it must not. Relative paths will be looked up first relative to the path of current CSS file being parsed. If no such file exists the relative path will be used relative the theme's path.

    Allow theme to design how to draw window icon in window content when window is unmapped (window content is unavaiable)
    
    Add themable properties to XfdashboardLiveWindows which control how the window icon is drawn in window content when window is unmapped due to window manager limitations, e.g. window is minized or window is not at active workspace when using xfwm4. The properties are prefixed with "unmapped-window-icon-".

    Try not to eat up CPU
    
    If a new window is created an instance of XfdashboardWindowContent is created and xfdashboard_window_content_set_window is called once for this new window. This function sets up the window content object to retrieve live updates. But it also sets up for live updates if xfdashboard is running in daemon mode and it is not active at this time. The result is that the window content texture is updated in background all the time until xfdashboard gets active and is suspended again then the window content's suspend function is called which stops listening for live update until xfdashboard is resumed.
    
    This CPU usage is unneccessary so call window content's suspend function immediately in xfdashboard_window_content_set_window after it has been set up for live update to reduce CPU usage again.
    
    I hope this fixes issue #44

    First version of workaround getting image of minimited windows.
    
    The workaround is as follows:
    * Set up signal handlers to get notified about changes of window
    * Unminimize window
    * If window is visible it will be activated by design (we shoud reactivate last active window - but this is _NOT_ implemented now!)
    * Minimize window again
    * Stop watching for changes of window by disconnecting signal handlers
    
    Please notice: The daemon mode of xfdashboard is _NOT_ tested now!

    Implement effects into XfdashboardActor
    
    XfdashboardActor has a new property 'effects' which takes a space-separated list of IDs of effects to create. The IDs must be found in effects XML file specified in "Effects=..." in theme description file xfdashboard.theme. The default theme defines a 'black-white' effect which decolorizes the actor and all quicklaunch buttons will get this effect added but the list is emptied at hovered button in quicklaunch. Effects can be expensive (seen from performance point of view) so changing effects on hover is a bad idea. So the default theme is currently a bad theme but a visible example was needed :(
    
    This closes issue #34

    Adding XML parser for effects to theme
    
    First step in closing issue #34 by implementing a XML parser to theme which can read in XML data for effects. To get an effect XML file loaded the descriptive xfdashboard.theme file needs a new entry "Effects=" with a semi-colon separated list of files to load. The new XfdashboardThemeEffects object still misses the "real" creation function and also the basic XfdashboardActor does not make any use of it yet. But this is also only step one ;)

    Move selection if current one gets unavailable
    
    The new generic selection frameworks now recognizes if the current selection is getting unavailable because the current selected actor is going to be hidden or destroyed. Then it moves the selection to next available and selectable actor. Focusable actors do not need to handle destroyed actor which are selected by themselve anymore so remove this code logic (XfdashboardQuicklaunch and XfdashboardWindowsView).

    Simplify and generalize selection handling
    
    Implemented a generic and common selection handling framework in XfdashboardFocusable. This has the advantage that we do not need to shift the key focus around between nothing and search box's text-box. We can also implement more common key press/release event like HOME and END keys to select first or last selectable item at the current focussed actor. Currently the keys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, HOME, END, ENTER are recognized by this framework. Still missing are PAGE_UP and PAGE_DOWN. The disadvantage is that "uncommon" key events like CTRL+ENTER have to be catched by signal handler connected to 'key-press-event" and 'key-release-event' at the actor in question like XfdashboardWindowsView.
    
    The search view is the only actor/view not implementing this framework as the decision if search view should be completely rewritten was not yet made.
    
    This is also preparation work for (maybe coming) plugins.

    Avoid closing windows accidently with key <Backspace>
    
    A window can accidently be closed when starting a search by typing and correcting more letters than entered with key <Backspace>. Because then the view switchs from search view back to windows view, sets the focus to a window in the windows and the additional <Backspace> key press will close it. Changed behaviour that the shift key has to be pressed also when using <Backspace>. <Delete> will still work as before.
    
    This commit addresses issue #32.

    Split key handling function into "specialized" functions
    
    Split key handling function in XfdashboardFocusable into "specialized" functions for 'key-press' and 'key-release' events. This make handling repeative 'key-press' event easier and cleaner (code), e.g. for moving selection when key is pressed and hold pressed. 'key-release' is only called once when pressed key is released.

    Revert changes to _xfdashboard_image_content_setup_for_icon to allow empty icon names
    
    Revert changes to _xfdashboard_image_content_setup_for_icon in XfdashboardImageContent which allows to fallback to fallback icon (aka missing image) if an empty string was set, e.g. by @try_icons in CSS. Empty string will now prevent loading any image as intended. To fallback to fallback icon in @try_icon you should declare a constant like @missing-icon with either the icon name to fallback to or with @try_icons(...) function with a list of fallback icons to try. This @missing-icon can be used in CSS with "@try_icons(..., ..., ..., @missing-icon);". This variant is used in xfdashboard's default theme.

    Implement file @-functions in CSS
    
    The CSS parser was extended with a file function called @try_icons. This functions take a variable number of strings as functions arguments and lookups each one in the order they are given. The first argument which can be lookuped successfully will be returned. If no none can be lookuped an empty string will be returned which causes xfdashboard to load the fallback icon (aka missing icon). Each argument can either be an absolute path, a relative path to theme's path or a (stock) icon name. This commit closes issue #9

    Alpha color component in @rgba() is a factor between 0.0 and 1.0 and not a common color component
    
    Fix alpha function parameter retrieval and calculation. It was a mistake to handle the alpha color component as a common color component which can be defined either an integer between 0 and 255 or as a percentage between 0% and 100%. The alpha color component is a factor and therefore must be a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.

    Improve search speed a little bit
    
    Improve search speed by caching loaded .desktop files. Before this commit each time the result list is retrieved, each item' .desktop file was loaded, parsed and additional information retrieved. Then this result list was sorted what caused the .desktop files being loaded, parsed etc. or each item. To avoid this each .desktop loaded will be cached so it will be only loaded once. At my slowest machine this reduced the mean search time for the term 'a' from 350ms to 240ms.

    Updated application icon set

    Set default hint label in search-box if none was set
    
    Check if a hint text was set and set default hint label if not. XfdashboardTextBox exports a read-only property "hint-text-set" for this purpose. If either an empty or non-empty (but not NULL) string is set as hint label this flag will be set TRUE. A NULL string will unset "hint-text-set" property, means set to FALSE.
    
    To get the default hint label set in search-box just do _not_ set property "hint-text" in theme's layout file. To get an empty hint label specify an empty "hint-text" in theme's layout file. Otherwise set hint label to the text wanted.

    We connect to "destroy" signal at current selection and if it gets destroyed we move selection to next or previous actor whatever is available. Then we disconnect signal handler on old selection and connect it at new selection.

    Emit "loaded" or "loading-failed" signal each time XfdashboardImage was attached
    
    Do not only emit these signals only once which can only retrieved by actor already created and already attached to theses signal. Emit these signals also each time an already loaded image is attached. But keep attention: You have to connect to these signals _before_ the image is attached to an actor and after the signal's callback was called it should be disconnected.

    Try to create GDesktopAppInfo for GarconMenuItem first then fallback to previous method
    
    We try first to create a GDesktopAppInfo for the requested GarconMenuItem. If it succeeds launching the application via this GDesktopAppInfo will behave as expected, e.g. setting working directory from "Path=..." of desktop file etc. If this creation fails fallback to old method with its restriction, e.g. not setting the working directory etc.

    Workaround if loading themed icon via filename with extension is not supported by default
    
    In cases where _xfdashboard_image_content_load_from_icon_name() gets a filename with extension, e.g. "skype.png", and gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon() fails to lookup icon then fallback to lookup icon without extension. But before doing this lookup we check if gdk-pixbuf supports this file extension at any of its formats.

    Simplify checking visibility of a garcon menu element
    
    Just call get_visible() on a GarconMenuElement as it will do already all extensive checks if this element should be visible or not. There is no need to do our additional checks because they are already done. But we still have to count the number of visible sub-menus and menu items to determine if we should show or hide a menu.

    Do not list empty menus in application menu model
    
    To prevent listing empty menus we iterate through the menu items of a menu first and look if there is at least one visible (sub-)menu or menu item. If we do not find any visible ones we do not process this menu and do not add it to list of menus so it will not show up.

    Add support to prevent upscaling beyond real size in XfdashboardScaledTableLayout
    
    The layout manager XfdashboardScaledTableLayout got a new property called "prevent-upscaling" which is set to FALSE by default. This property manages if layout manager is allowed to scale a child larger than its real natural size or not. The windows view uses this new property and exports it by itself to allow windows to be scaled beyond their real size or not. As it is a stylable property it can be control by a theme.

    Warning: Massive API break because of renamed class and functions. Renamed XfdashboardImage to XfdashboardImageContent to keep class name in sync with naming convention I used so far (see XfdashboardWindowContent for a ClutterContent derived class and ClutterImage, which XfdashboardImage is derived from, is also a ClutterContent derived class). Also XfdashboardImage is now free e.g. for an actor utilizing XfdashboardImageContent.

    Move stylable functions into an interface
    
    XfdashboardActor will not implement and provide styling possibilities but implements the new stylable interface (XfdashboardStylable). Moving the functionality into an interface gives us the opportunity to style non-actors also (anytime later).
    
    Why should non-actors be stylable by CSS? That's because non-actors like XfdashboardWindowContents or XfdashboardImage will be visible because they are used by (visible and drawn) actors. This is not implemented yet but prepared.

    Rename key in theme file from "LayoutPrimary" to "Layout"
    
    When writing documentation about how to layout xfdashboard I saw that is was not wise to name the key "LayoutPrimary". Because the key takes a list of file, separated by semicolon, there is no need to differ between layout files and their purposes. Only the attribute "id" of the object element which is the child of interface needs to set correctly.

Outline is now a effect which takes care that outline is drawn last and is always visible. Also a new property "outline-borders" (XfdashboardBackground) which "maps" to "borders" in new XfdashboardOutlineEffect class and manages which sides (and also which rounded corner) should be drawn.

    Added infrastructure for search providers. Registered search providers will be called each time a search is performed - either as full search or as incremental search to a previous one if each search term in new search is a prefix of its counterpart in new search and if their order did not change. Search provider can use any source for their search but have to create an actor for each item in their result if requested. The newly added search manager manages all search providers at one place. Search view was rewritten to use this new search infrastructure.

    Avoid unnessary rebuilds of applicatios view when changing properties. E.g. it is not neccessary to rebuild applications view if format string to render title and description changes but view mode in search mode is "icon" which uses only the format string for title-only names.

    Commit d82c491d2c15525d4f052100234274936ae03aa5 broke correct stage size when window is fullscreen. Add some checks at compile to restore old correct behaviour at least for clutter versions prior the problematic ones (1.16+)

    Do not resize stage after window was opened
    
    This commit addresses issue #1. It seems that starting with clutter 1.16 the way how the stage window is created within clutter changed resulting that coordinates in stage window were transformed wrongly although there were no visible differences. By setting stage actor's size (and therefore window size) when actor is created and before window is created by clutter the right transformation was restored.

The first one will fill the hashtable only with stylable properties of requested and the latter one will also get the stylable properties of all parent classes recursively.

    Fix bug that XfdashboardCollapseBox collapse even if pointer device is still inside actor
    
    There are a few situations where only a "leave-event" signal without a following "enter-event" signal is emitted although the pointer is still inside the XfdashboardCollapseBox actor. So the actor is shrinked to minimum size accidently. This happens most when switching through workspaces. So we first check if the new target actor is a direct or deeper child of the collapse box and if it is not then we check if the actor under pointer device is a direct or deeper child. If both checks fails then the pointer device should be really outside the collapse box and it is allowed to shrink to minimum size.

    Added missing license in file COPYING
    
    If I understood the table at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility then I could not use any other license than GPL-2+ because all library I use (or better I link to) are LGPL-2.1 only or LGPL-2.1+ except for xfconf. xfconf might be GPL-2 only and incompatible to GPL-3 or its LGPL-2.1 only but compatible to GPL-3. xfconf mixes the "short license text" in source code and includes GPL-2 in COPYING. As long as I cannot determine the "real" license I use GPL-2 just in case.
    
    My thoughts are only valid if I understood the table and if linking to other libraries is "I want to use a library" (in context of table).

The XfdashboardApplicationModel will then clear and (re-)load itself to get the new menu structure. After that it emits signal "loaded" (as it will on creation) to notify all handlers about (re-)load.

    Consider minimized window as visible ones.
    
    In real minimized windows are hidden but with additional flag "minimized". To distinguish between completely hidden window and just minimized window we check flag "minimized" additionally. Only if flag "hidden" is set and "minimized" flag is not set the window is recognized as hidden by application. Without this differentiation also minimized window will not show up in windows view and will not be selectable or restorable to previous state (a visible state) anymore. At least not via xfdashboard but via task switcher (ALT+Tab).

    This change should ensure that each remote instance will force the primary instance to resume (means show the stage window). Before this change g_application_activate() called from remote instance did not send the dbus signal to the primary instance or the signal did not reach the primary instance. Because of this the stage window was not (re-)shown reliable.

    Move logic to connect signals for getting stage window and setting fullscreen state of stage to overriden virtual function show() of ClutterActor. Therefore it should always work (to handle emitted signals) where ever show() of stage was called at.

    We cannot assume that each window newly opened or moved to a workspace will be on top of all other windows. It highly depends on the window manager and personal settings. We need to respect window stacking. Therefore we iterate through list of windows in stacking order to find the last window the live workspace has an actor for before we the window requested to insert a new actor at this position or move an existing window actor to this position.

    To prevent emiting our motion events in XfdashboardDragAction on actors being destroyed while drag is in progress (e.g. a window actor was destroyed because its window was closed) we connect to 'destroy' signal of each "motion actor" added to list. The signal handler will be removed either on actor's destruction by signal handler's callback, when pointer leaves actor or on end of drag.

    Add new actor XfdashboardCollapseBox which holds (better: handles) only one child and acts like a expander. The stage puts XfdashboardWorkspaceSelector into such a collapse box to save space in stage. The workspace selector will then expand as soon as the pointer moves into it and will collapse when pointer moved out. XfdashboardDragAction has to handle and emit 'enter-event', 'leave-event' and 'motion-event' on its own because ClutterDragAction will turn off motion handling but it is needed to keep XfdashboardCollapseBox functional. That means the collapse box should still expand and collapse while a drag is in progress.

    Commit initial basic workspace selector what is like a pager. It is a simple one for now as it only shows the windows' icon in relative size to their real size and not the window content. The active workspace will be highlighted by an white outline. Workspace can be activated by clicking on it. Drag'n'drop support is not yet implemented.

    Remove any reference to libwnck in all object except for window tracker related objects. Window tracker objects wrap libwnck resources directly but are accessible in a "virtual" stable API. Doing it this way should provide a stable API for libwnck throughout all code and the only place to work with #ifdef's to work around changing libwnck API are the window tracker objects.

    Windows view should now really always fit into viewpad without scrollbars to flicker. There is caution to use the new enum XFDASHBOARD_FIT_MODE_BOTH as the view _MUST_ be able to scale itself to fit into allocation _ALWAYS_ otherwise it will be clipped without being able to scroll (as there are no scrollbars in this mode).

    Bad workaround for click action which prevents e.g. drag actions to work properly at least since clutter version 1.12. The click action will always win and "drag-begin" will never be emitted.
    
    This object/file is a complete copy of the original clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of clutter 1.12 except for one line, renamed function names and applied coding style. As the clutter-click-action.{c,h} files of later clutter versions do not differ much from this one this object is expected to work even in this versions.

    Implement enabled/disabled state of a view. XfdashboardViewpad will not allow to activate a disabled view and switch to first activatable view if the current active view was disabled. XfdashboardViewSelector will show or hide the button for a view depending on its enable/disable state.

    Implemented applications menu model which collects menu entries via garcon library. It can be used to display menu entries in a view in different ways: all entries, all entries of a menu and by sections like games, office etc. Two helper functions will help to filter the entries by menu or section.
    
    Changed applications view to show applications menu entries instead of a clock ;) Clicking on a folder will show its contents but clicking on a menu item will start the associated application.
    
    Also improved view to allow to scroll to requested position.

    Improved viewpad to allow fitting a view in one direction into viewpad. Therefore a new virtual function (*set_fit_mode) was added to abstract class XfdashboardView for reacting on fit mode changed in view (new type XfdashboardFitMode). Corrected scrollbar and clipping behaviour of viewpad.

Author: Stephan Haller <nomad@froevel.de>
Date:   Mon Aug 19 23:23:47 2013 +0200

    Implemented basic version of XfdashboardFitBoxLayout which layouts children like ClutterBoxLayout but takes care to fit into parent actor's width or height depending on orientation. It will alway set width or height of every child to match parent's size but it can scale it to keep aspect ratio if wanted. When implementing this layout manager also some minor errors and misbehaviours of some other actors were corrected (and hopefully throw no warnings or criticals anymore).

    Speed up scrolling because it got worse after speeding up search. The reason was that each time the scrollbar moved (value-changed signal emitted) all actors were re-allocated and re-layouted even the hidden ones. Speeding it up by just moving view and clipping of view but only it view has clipping.

    Initial support for drag-n-drop. I needed to implement my own DropAction because I could get clutter's own one get working e.g. for just quicklaunch area. As soon as I crossed an application icon in quicklaunch it stopped emitting signals to underlying quicklaunch. And implementing my own DropAction caused implementing my own DragAction which is derived from clutter's one.

    Set minimum version of external libraries as requirements to avoid using macros not available and makes handling different version a lot harder. BTW libwnck below 2.10 is
    very old and hardly in use nowadays so we can not support these versions. Also made compiler more quiet with -std=gnu99 but should be still warn.

    Allow libwnck library prior to version 3.0 and provide version checks
    macros in this case. Changed also stupid Makefile to reflect this.
